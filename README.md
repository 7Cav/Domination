All maps supported by Domination are released as PBOs.  However you can use any PBO tool to modify and bundle your own mission modifications.  Choose `co30_Domination.Altis` as the PBO source to bundle the default map (Altis).

If you want to bundle or modify maps other than Altis follow these steps:

* delete `co30_Domination.Altis/mission.sqm`
* copy the appropriate `mission.sqm` file from `mission_sqm` folder into `co30_Domination.Altis`
* rename the file you copied to `mission.sqm`
* delete `co30_Domination.Altis/x_setup.sqf`
* copy the appropriate `x_setup.sqf` file from `mission_sqm` folder into `co30_Domination.Altis`
* rename the file you copied to `x_setup.sqf`
* rename `co30_Domination.Altis` folder to `co30_Domination.NewMap` (for example `co30_Domination.Malden`)
* run your preferred PBO tool with PBO source folder `co30_Domination.Malden`

Remember that your modifications can only be shared with the community if you contribute your work back to the source repository.
